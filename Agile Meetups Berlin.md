# *Agile Meetups Berlin*

1.  [20x20 Agile Night ](https://www.meetup.com/20x20-Agile-Night/)- Held annually, the 20x20 agile night at [Idealo](https://www.idealo.de/) plays host to nine speakers who present 20 slides in 20 seconds on various agile related topics. Presentations are done in both English and German. 
2.  [Agile Berg](https://www.meetup.com/Agile-Berg/) - Meeting twice a year, this group catering to the software development community and those who are interested in sharing and learning various Agile practices. 
3.  [Agile Game Lab](https://www.meetup.com/Agile-Game-Lab-Berlin/) - If you like games, all things agile, and are keen on exploring new ways to work. Join the Agile Game Lab. People come together by co-creating or playing Agile themed games and simulations. If you have an idea for a game, this is the place where you can come and try it out, learning how to deal with problems that might creep up and get candid feedback from fellow peers. This meet up takes place every two months or so.
4.  [Agile Nights by Agile TD ](https://www.meetup.com/Agile-Nights-by-AgileTD/)- A meetup run by the folks over at Agile Testing Days, this is another space to come and learn about Agile topics, testing activities, design thinking, and workshops on subjects like decision making models. The meet-ups seem to be infrequent, but sign up, and get notifications when new meetups are scheduled.
5. [Alternative Leadership Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Alternative-Leadership-and-Team-Organization/) - If you are into organisational design, this meetup is for you. Come to hear from various Berlin based leaders present on a number of topics like remote work, employee onboarding, and more. Sadly, the group hasn’t been active for two years, but watch the space to see if they’ll someday host these meetups once more.
